#### Created by using Amesim submodel editor
---
Submodel Editor allows you to integrate new icons and submodels into the Simcenter Amesim
package so that they can be used just like standard Simcenter Amesim icons and submodels.
Producing new submodels involves writing your own code that must be in the correct format to allow
Simcenter Amesim to call it. Submodel Editor creates a code skeleton in this format to which
you add your own statements to implement your submodel.
